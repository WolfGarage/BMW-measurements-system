ABSTRACT        
	The point of this diploma is to create a system that measures sound levels emitted by the car roof modules. Car manufacturers are experiencing problems with excessive loudness coming from modules especially in premium class brands. This is caused by electronics such as capacitors, coils or mechanical switches. It was decided that a new device will be created based on the microphone array and anechoic chamber. Scope of work includes creating software, modifying a case and adjusting a device to process audio signals. Software is able to show, process and analyse signals by the FFT algorithm in frequency range from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. Case is capable of doing a measurement of roof modules isolated from the noisy environment. To safely measure electronics inside the created case, a specially designed mount was created. Measurements can be read from 6 microphones placed on the microphone array. Extended functionality of the program allows the user to take the saved spectrum of the graph and show it side by side. Created device was tested on roof modules. Received results were analysed. Possible future upgrades and summary were placed at the end of this work.
